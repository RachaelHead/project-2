    <h1> The <strong>History</strong> of <strong>Acupuncture</strong> </h1>
    <p>
      Acupuncture is practice that originates from Traditional Chinese Medicine. In acupuncture practice, the body has an energy, Qi (pronounced chee), that flows through meridians and pathways.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proper flow of Qi provides good overall health. When this flow is interrupted or blocked, disease, pain and inflammation can occur. Acupuncturists utilize more than 2,000 acupuncture points to redirect and aid the flow of Qi to relieve pain and heal disease.
